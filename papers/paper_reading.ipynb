    "In my previous understanding, diffusion models are typically highly coupled with image generation tasks, where the convention of a diffusion model is to gradually generate a structurally sound and semantically clear image through a step-by-step denoising process from pure Gaussian noise. Using a diffusion model was somewhat beyond my current intuitive understanding of this type of models, urging me to take a closer look on how this paper achieves SOTA performance of this field."

    "Later this week, I encountered some practical difficulties when when attempting to reconstruct 3D hand states using hand pose annotation and monocular depth estimation, espeically monocular depth estimation via UniDepth. These challenges motivated to come up with an alternative way to get the vital data to reconstruct the world state: to simply generate a virtual world where all data are explicitly accessible so that we can bypass such challenge. This led to my explorarion on world models, the models runs on physical and spatial laws."
